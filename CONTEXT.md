# Flow Atlas — Domain Context

Domain vocabulary for Flow Atlas (the Azure Logic App &amp; Service Bus Explorer). Use these terms
exactly in code, tests, and architecture discussion.

## Inventory domain

- **Logic App** — a Standard Logic App (`Microsoft.Web/sites`, `kind=workflowapp`). Has a name, a
  running/stopped state, and a set of Workflows. Modelled by `LogicAppInfo`.
- **Workflow** — one workflow inside a Logic App. Has a Trigger, a Classification, an optional
  Domain tag, and a list of outbound Call Edges. Modelled by `WorkflowInfo`.
- **Call Edge** — one outbound call extracted from an action in a workflow (`CallEdge`): the action
  name, its **Call Type**, and its **External Target**.
- **Call Type** — what kind of thing a call reaches (`CallType`): Http, Function, Salesforce,
  ManagedConnector, ServiceProvider, ServiceBus, ChildWorkflow, KeyVault, Unknown.
- **External Target** — the resolved (or best-effort) destination of a Call Edge (`ExternalTarget`):
  host / function app / connector / workflow name, plus an optional path and raw expression.
- **Trigger** — how a workflow is started (`TriggerInfo`): kind, optional Service Bus entity
  name/kind, optional HTTP method.
- **Service Bus Topic** — an Azure Service Bus topic and its child subscriptions
  (`ServiceBusTopicInfo`).
- **Inventory** — the full scan result: all Logic Apps, their Workflows and Call Edges, the Service
  Bus Topics, scan errors, and a timestamp. Persisted as a **Snapshot**.
- **Inventory Selection** — what the user has chosen to view (`InventorySelection`): a set of
  Logic App names, a set of workflow keys (`appName||wfName`, see `WorkflowKey`), and/or a
  free-text keyword. `InventorySelection.All` is unfiltered. `InventoryFilter.Apply` is the one
  seam that turns a Selection into a narrowed Inventory — the Explorer view, the table, the
  diagram, and the tests all cross it the same way.

## Scan orchestration

- **Logic App Reads** (`ILogicAppReads`) — the narrow set of ARM/Service Bus reads
  `ScanService` needs to build an Inventory: list Standard Logic Apps, list/read workflows,
  read connections.json/parameters.json, and enumerate Service Bus namespaces/topics/
  subscriptions. `AzureLogicAppClient` is the live ARM adapter; `FakeLogicAppReads` (test-only)
  is a fixture-backed adapter, so `ScanService`'s orchestration — parallel scanning, per-app/
  per-workflow error aggregation, stopped-app skipping — is tested without an Azure login.

## Connector identity

- **Connector Taxonomy** (`ConnectorTaxonomy`) — the single place that knows what a connector
  *is*: managed-API slugs (e.g. `salesforce`, `office365`) and `serviceProviderId` values (e.g.
  `/serviceProviders/serviceBus`, `/serviceProviders/keyVault`) each map to a Call Type, a
  display name, and (for Service Bus / Key Vault) friendly operation labels. `ConnectionsParser`
  (connections.json → `ConnectionsLookup`) and `WorkflowParser` (inline `ServiceProvider`
  actions/triggers) both read from this one module instead of cross-calling each other.

## Workflow interactions

- **Interaction** (`InteractionView`, built by `WorkflowInteractions.Build`) — one deduplicated
  outbound call shown as a chip: a Call Type, an optional "detail" (HTTP method, or friendly
  Service Bus / Key Vault operation), a target, an optional raw expression, and a count of how
  many edges collapsed into it. The Raw Inventory table and the CSV export both project a
  workflow's Call Edges through this one module, so the chips shown on screen and the rows
  written to CSV can never disagree.

## Diagram presentation

- **Node Kind** — the kind of node a diagram can draw (`NodeKind`). Eight kinds mirror the Call
  Types that produce an outbound target node; three are structural roles that are **not** Call Types:
  **Logic App**, **Workflow**, and **Trigger Source**. `CallType.Unknown` folds to the Http node kind.
- **Node Style** — the visual identity of one Node Kind (`NodeStyle`): Mermaid class, fill colour,
  text/stroke colours, legend label, node subtitle, and Bootstrap badge class.
- **Diagram Palette** — the single source of truth mapping each Node Kind to its Node Style
  (`DiagramPalette`). The Mermaid builder, the legend, and the inventory table all read from it, so a
  node kind's colour is defined exactly once — the legend swatch and the generated Mermaid `classDef`
  fill are the same field and cannot drift apart.
